MoonDAO is accelerating our multiplanetary future with an open platform to fund, collaborate, and compete on challenges that get us closer to a lunar settlement. We aim to bring a global community of space builders, hackers, and developers together into a thriving movement dedicated to making a self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon a reality. Join us by contributing to one of our repos, joining the [community in Discord](https://discord.gg/moondao), becoming a [Citizen](https://moondao.com/join) of the Space Acceleration Network, or by [getting $MOONEY](https://moondao.com/get-mooney) to participate in governance.
